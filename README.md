# Spot the Bot: Distinguishing Human-Written and Bot-Generated Texts Using Clustering and Information Theory Techniques

In this work, we incorporate clustering and information theory techniques in order to study structural differences between human-written and bot-generated text data.

Clustering methods used:
- K-Means
- Fuzzy C-Means
- Wishart clustering
- Wishart clustering on fuzzy numbers

Results and source code can be found in the repository.
